A way to download anime. I'm not promoting privacy with this, my intention is to be able to watch anime when connectivity is poor.

It's best if you have a premium account, to be able to download premium content (high quality video), and to be fair to the publishers, even if they only get a small amount of the price you pay to be able to watch their content.
